# JavaScript conditions and loops

## If else statement
### even & odd numbers
- Write a function that takes a number as an input. 
- Write an if else statement in the function to check if the number is even or odd, and print the result in the console.

### Write a function that takes a score as an input and print the Grade:
If the score is: 
* 90 and above, then the grade is A 
* between 80 to 89, then the grade is B  
* between 70 to 79, then the grade is C 
* between 60 to 69, then the grade is D 
* 59 or below, then the grade is F

### Leap year (Bonus)
A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a lunisolar calendar, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year.
- Write a function that takes a year as an input and print true if the year is a leap year, and false otherwise
- **Hint:** to know if the year is leap or not:
    - The year must be divisible by 4 AND not divisible by 100 OR the year divisible by 400

## For loop
### Fibonacci sequence: 

* Write a program that prints the first 20 elements of Fibonacci sequence: 

* Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers, and the first two wlements are 0 and 1

* it starts like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..

## While loop
### odd numbers
* Using while loop, print odd numbers from 1-20

### power of 2 (Bonus)
*  Using while loop, write a program that prints true if a number is a power of 2, and 0 otherwise
