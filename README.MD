# JavaScript conditions and loops

## If else statement
### even & odd numbers
- Write a function that takes a number as an input 
- Write an if else statement in the function to check if the number is even or odd, and print the result in the console


### Leap year (Bonus)
A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a lunisolar calendar, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year.
- Write a function that takes a year as an input and print true if the year is a leap year, and false otherwise
- **Hint:** to know if the year is leap or not:
    - The year must be divisible by 4 AND not divisible by 100 OR the year divisible by 400
